## About me 

I’m a Sydney based Software Engineer with a background in Architecture who’s keen to build technology products in order to make everyone’s lives easier, viewing every new challenge as an opportunity to grow and learn.

Throughout my thirteen years of experience being an architect I realised that what I liked the most in my job was making the building functional, working hard on space planning and trying to find the most efficient way for people to experience the spaces and the connections between them. This logical approach led me onto the path of programming. I believe that working as a software engineer will enhance my skills and interests in solving real world problems through technology.

- I'm taking General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive and currently learning React.

I’m looking for opportunities that match with my purpose and give me exposure to continuous learning in the technology field. Please feel free to get in touch with me. I welcome the chance to connect and explore potential collaboration.
